# Interactive Mandelbrot Plot

## Mandelbrot Set

The set of numbers for which the function f(z) = z^2 + c remain bounded.

I learned about implementing the Mandelbrot set as an image in python here: https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/2358/how-to-plot-the-mandelbrot-set/mandelbrot-set
But I wanted to make an interactive interface that allows repeated zooming in and out so I could explore the Mandelbrot set and visualise its infinite nature.

## Controls
- Drag mouse over an area to zoom in
- Escape key to quit
- Back key to re plot zoomed out mandelbrot
